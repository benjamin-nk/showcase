How have i decided to deal with missing or incomplete data?

CSE:
- Any missing data results in the score being NULL_INCOMPLETE
-> This is because to calculate a valid CSE score, all of the questions need to be answered.
- All missing data result in the score being NULL_EMPTY

CAQ:
- Any individual domains that are unanswered become NULL_EMPTY
- All missing individual domain data results in the Global Score being NULL_EMPTY
- Global Score is calculated even if some individual domains are unanswered. They are being treated as 0.

HMT-S:
- Any missing data results in the score being NULL_INCOMPLETE
-> This is because to calculate a valid HMTS score, all of the questions need to be answered.
- All missing data result in the score being NULL_EMPTY 

IPIP-50:
- Any missing data for a single domain results in that domain being NULL_INCOMPLETE
- All missing data for a single domain results in that domain being NULL_EMPTY
-* Domains are scored independentally of each other.

AUAI-Fluency:
- Empty data of a task (uses/instances) results in the score being NULL_EMPTY
- If all of the Uses or Instances tasks are NULL_EMPTY then the total score for Uses/Instances is NULL_INCOMPLETE
-> It should really be NULL EMPTY but i haven't written the code to account for multiple uses or instances tasks
- If all tasks of both Uses and Instances are NULL_EMPTY then the overall fluency score is NULL_EMPTY
- If only one of the overall scores for Uses or Instances is NULL_EMPTY then teh overall fluency score is calculated with what is given
-> This allows for the possiblity that the participant cannot think of a single thing.
