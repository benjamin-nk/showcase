-=-=-=-=-=-To-Do-=-=-=-=-=-
- Nothing!?
- Test this program's automatic coding against manual coding of data.

### Non-priorities
- Each scale/module will need to create its own table 4/5 completed [auaifluency,cse,hmts,ipip50]
--> Recode create tables and writing tables to account for 'null' entries
---> could be simply? Or not? Custom SQL code to be written to not submit an entry where field == null
----> would have to supply one less parameter ot the SQL query.
- consider making scales inherit methods for checking for missing entries

### Impractical Possibilities ###
# [] Add way to manually input qualtrics column names for each module
# [] Data handling between-subjects and within-subjects

## Notes ##
---* i will need to check fluency manuaally because people can put in typos


-=-=-=-=Change-log-=-=-=-=-

A-long-time-ago
- created function for measing participant completion times on qualtrics questions
- created function to parse qualtrics data and print it in a friendly/pretty format
- created participant function
16-10-22
- created class for scales
- created method for registering scales
- created method framework for creating scales' SQL tables (createtables)
- created method framework for creating scales' csv output (preparecsv) for further SPSS analysis
- made participant profiles object-oriented
- integrated scales' data with participant profiles (setprofile)
- created method to compile csv output from multiple scales and participants into single csv file
- added preparecsv for auaifluency,cse,hmts
- added createtables for auaifluency,cse,
17-10-22
- added hmts createtables
- added ipip50 createtables
- added ipip50 preparecsv
- added caq preparecsv
- edited writecsv registerparticipants module function
- timming pid off of concated csvs from multiple scales
20-10-22
- done CSE (Clean missing data with 'null' insertions)
- done hmts
21-10-22
- done IPIP50
- done auaifluency
- done CAQ
-* create contingencies for missing entries
-* account for making reponses null if they only contain whitespace with nothign else
1 - done - add auto-incremented case numbers so i can differentiate between datasets
2 - done - I need to capture the demographic data - answers to other questions and include them in the csv that i will be working from.
3 - DEMO GRAPHICS i might want to also add date of submission to my csv data collection - so if i change ethics i can find which data has given consent
22-10-22
- fixed auaifluency multiple commas as multiple auaifluency answers
- added NULL_FLAGS to replace 'null'
- Created NULL_FLAGS for Empty scale data versus Incomplete scale data Done: HMTS, CSE, auaifluency, ipip50, CAQ
- CAQ ***Missing Data (skipped) domains is being treated as 0 - See line ~163+*** 

-=-=-=-=Thought-log-=-=-=-=-
- trim off pid because there will be multiple columns of it from each of the scales
- I can do this by removing header[0] and row[0] after the first scale
- Each scale/module will need to prepare its own csv 5/5 completed
- [auaifluency,cse,hmts,ipip50,caq]
- Problem: scores 0 i need to input NULL values instead
-- To deal with missing cases i need to gather the field names of the scales' questions and put them into a table.
-- Then I can query across each response and fill the values with NULL
-- I should have the program ask for a model response ID, this ID will be a manually completed response with all of the questions answered

This is not needed for simply computing data. This is data aggregation. Another project. [- what if instead of single tables for each module, we created a single table to comprise all the data?
-- alternative to this, we need to include a key of the study ID so that cross-comparisons can be made
- I need to know what Qualtrics data, multiple scales and tables would look like in pythonanywhere admin OR single tables AND how this would be sorted]
20-10-22
- consider making scales inherit methods for checking for missing entries
-- contingencies will need to be addressed in each individual module
-- OR in fact afterwards, in clean up, comparing each participants entries... ill need to do some thinking
--- to do this i can create a question template for each qualtrics scale then compare keys to find the missing entries?
22-10-22
- # (caq-model participant template creation) This makes me think though if this is creating templates, does it create templates when the times_i/ii questions are chosen?
- # -> yes because we are only check that the main domain question has been answered. the times_i/ii scores are dealt with sepearately and if answered and empty it becomes 1
